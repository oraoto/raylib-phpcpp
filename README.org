* raylib-phpcpp

PHP bindings for [[https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/][raylib]], a simple and easy-to-use library to learn videogames programming.

It's developed using [[https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/PHP-CPP/][PHP-CPP]], so it's called raylib-phpcpp.

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php

InitWindow(800, 450, "raylib [core] example - basic window");

SetTargetFPS(60);

while (!WindowShouldClose())
{
    BeginDrawing();
    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE());
    DrawText("Congrats! You created your first window!", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY());
    EndDrawing();
}
CloseWindow();
#+END_SRC

See more [[./examples][examples]].

** Build

Run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
#+END_SRC

Then you have ~libraylib-phpcpp.so~ in build directory.

** Mapping C to PHP

- All C functions are exposed as PHP global functions, for example:

  | C                             | raylib-phpcpp                 |
  |-------------------------------+-------------------------------|
  | WindowShouldClose()           | WindowShouldClose()           |
  | InitWindow(800, 450, "title") | InitWindow(800, 450, "title") |

- Color constants are exposed as global functions, for example:

  | C         | raylib-phpcpp |
  |-----------+---------------|
  | LIGHTGRAY | LIGHTGRAY()   |
  | GREEN     | GREEN()       |

- All C enums are exposed as global constants with ~RL_~ prefix:

  | C              | raylib-phpcpp     |
  |----------------+-------------------|
  | FLAG_SHOW_LOGO | RL_FLAG_SHOW_LOGO |
  | KEY_COMMA      | RL_KEY_COMMA      |

- Constructor for simple structs (struct without array and pointer members) are exposed as function, for example to create a ~Camera2D~:

  #+BEGIN_SRC php
  <?php

  $offset = Vector2(1, 1);
  $target = Vector2(0, 0);
  $camera = Camera2D($offset, $target, 1.0, 1.0);
  #+END_SRC

- Accessor for struct fields are implemented as ~__get~ and ~__set~, some update operation are more cumbersome:

  #+BEGIN_SRC php
  <?php

  $v = Vector2(1, 2);
  // $v->x += 1; doesn't work
  $v->x = $v->x + 1;

  $camera = Camera2D(Vector2(1, 1), Vector2(0, 0), 1.0, 1.0);
  // $camera->target->x = 1; // doesn't work
  $target = $camera->target;
  $target->x = 1;
  $camera->target = $target;
  #+END_SRC

- Known name conflicts

  | raylib-phpcpp | PHP          |
  |---------------+--------------|
  | ImageCopy     | [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php][gd extension]] |
  | ImageCrop     | [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php][gd extension]] |

  You should disable gd extension while exploring raylib :)

- API differences

  TBD.

  | Function            |
  |---------------------|
  | GetDroppedFiles     |
  | ImageExtractPalette |
  | LoadModelAnimations |
  | LoadMeshes          |
  | LoadMaterials       |

** Completeness

Most functions and features are supported.

For most file and text functions, you can use counterparts in PHP.
